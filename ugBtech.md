## B.Tech. â€“ Undergraduate Programs

The Institute offers four undergraduate (B.Tech.) programs in engineering, following a semester system. Each academic year (July-April) includes two semesters, **Autumn** and **Spring**, each lasting approximately 16 weeks. The **Autumn semester** begins in the last week of July and ends by the last week of November, while the **Spring semester** runs from the first week of January to the last week of April. In the first year, all branches share a common curriculum, after which students follow specific curricula based on their chosen programs.

### Program Structure

The B.Tech. programs are structured over eight semesters across four years. The Institute follows a credit-based system, with credits assigned to courses based on the weekly hours of lectures, tutorials, and laboratory sessions. Student performance is evaluated continuously, resulting in a **Grade** on a 10-point scale by the semester's end.

- **Semester Performance Index (SPI):** Weighted average of grade points for courses in a semester.
- **Cumulative Performance Index (CPI):** Weighted average of grade points for all courses taken since joining.

### Admission and Seat Allocation

Admission to B.Tech. programs requires clearing the **JEE (Advanced)**. Available programs and seat distribution are as follows:
