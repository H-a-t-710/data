# Academic Curriculum

The Institute offers four undergraduate (B.Tech.) programs in engineering. IIT Goa follows a semester system. An academic year (July-April) consists of two semesters, each approximately 16 weeks in duration. The first semester begins in the last week of July and ends by the last week of November. The second semester starts in the first week of January and concludes by the last week of April. In each of the two semesters of the first year, students are required to register for the relevant courses listed in the curriculum for that semester.

The Institute follows a credit system. Credits are allotted to courses based on the number of lectures, tutorials, and laboratory hours per week. Student performance in each course is continuously evaluated throughout the semester, culminating in the award of a grade on a 10-point scale. 

- **Semester Performance Index (SPI):** The weighted average of grade points secured in all registered courses for a semester.
- **Cumulative Performance Index (CPI):** The weighted average of grade points obtained in all registered courses since joining the Institute.

For students admitted through JEE (Advanced) from 2016 onwards, IIT Goa offers a B.Tech. undergraduate program. The B.Tech. programs span eight semesters over four years, with a common curriculum across all branches in the first semester.
